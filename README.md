## 🚀 **Features Overview**

- **InitInterrupt Function**: Prepares the system for handling pin change interrupts and sets the relevant configurations.
- **PWM Timer Configuration**: Outlines the setup process to generate PWM signals.
- **Set Motor Direction**: Dynamically adjusts the motor's direction based on throttle and direction inputs.
- **Main Routine**: Houses the main logic and PID controller for motor operations.

## 🛠 **Installation & Setup**

1. **Dependencies**: 
    - Ensure you have the AVR library and toolchain installed.
    - `I2C.h` is required for interfacing with I2C devices.

2. **Configuration**: 
    - The `F_CPU` macro sets the clock speed. Adjust as per your microcontroller specifications.
    - The various #define macros such as `true`, `false`, `high`, and `low` provide better code readability.

3. **Deployment**:
    - Compile using the AVR toolchain.
    - Flash the binary to your AVR microcontroller.
    - Make sure to test the setup in a controlled environment before attaching it to the main system.

## 🎮 **Usage Instructions**

1. **Initialization**: Power up your system and make sure all connections are appropriately made.
2. **Calibration**: Ensure that the motor is calibrated and the feedback mechanism is functioning properly.
3. **Execution**: Power the microcontroller and observe the motor's behavior. Adjust the PID parameters for optimal performance as necessary.
